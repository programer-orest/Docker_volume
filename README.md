ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Docker

MySQL (official Docker image)

Django (Python framework)

Docker Hub (for image storage)

ðŸš€ What Was Done
1. Created Dockerfile.mysql to build a custom MySQL image based on the official MySQL Docker image.

2. Configured environment variables to initialize:

  - Database: app_db

  - User: app_user

  - Password: 1234

3. Built a MySQL Docker image tagged as mysql-local:1.0.0.

4. Created and attached Docker volumes to persist MySQL data outside the container.

5. Pushed the MySQL image to a personal Docker Hub repository.

6. Run the MySQL container locally with attached volumes.

7. Updated Django app database configuration to connect to the running MySQL containerâ€™s IP.

8. Built and ran the updated Django app container connected to the MySQL database.

9. Pushed the Django app image to Docker Hub with the tag todoapp:2.0.0.

10. Created INSTRUCTION.md with detailed steps for running both MySQL and Django app containers, including:

- Volume mounting

- Access instructions

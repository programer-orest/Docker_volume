Dockerizing Django-Todolist with MySQL and Volumes
Project Overview:
In this task, I containerized a Django todo-list web application with MySQL database using Docker. The main focus was on creating a persistent MySQL container with attached volumes and connecting the Django app container to the MySQL container.

Tech stack:
Docker
MySQL (official Docker image)
Django (Python framework)
Docker Hub (for image storage)
What was done:
Prepared a Dockerfile.mysql to build a custom MySQL image based on the official MySQL Docker image.
Configured environment variables to initialize the database (app_db) and user (app_user) with password 1234.
Built a MySQL Docker image tagged as mysql-local:1.0.0.
Created and attached Docker volumes to persist MySQL data outside of the container.
Pushed the MySQL image to my personal Docker Hub repository.
Ran MySQL container locally with volumes attached.
Updated Django app database configuration to point to the running MySQL container IP.
Built and ran the updated Django app container, connected to the MySQL database.
Pushed the Django app image to Docker Hub with tag todoapp:2.0.0.
Created INSTRUCTION.md with detailed steps on how to run both MySQL and Django app containers, including volume mounting and access instructions.
